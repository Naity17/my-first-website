# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! This is my very first website. It was built as part of my Code Institute Fullstack Web Development Program.

Here is [a link](https://naity17.github.io/my-first-website/index.html) to the website. 

## Project Description

This site was created in order to get familiar with common development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project itself will display a breakdown of the different technologies used in each of the different sections of the program

## Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
